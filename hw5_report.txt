Homework 5 Report

---Objective 1---
When the user requests the home page (line 125), I check the headers to see if
there is a cookie header available. To determine whether a user has visited the
page before, I keep send and read the "visited=true" cookie.

If there are no cookies, the welcome message is set to the default "Welcome" 
message, and the "visited=true" cookie is set on the next response. If the
"visited=true" cookie was recieved in the request, the welcome message is set 
to 'Welcome Back!'. This cookie will stay for all subsequent requests, so the
user will recieve the return message as long as the cookie exists.


---Objective 2 & 3---
For the login and register forms, I used the multipart encoding since I already
had all the relevant functions to parse it from previous homeworks.

When the user registers, their post request is sent to "/request" (line 74).
Once recieved, the values are parsed and the username/password is retrieved,
which are then stored into the "user" collection through MongoDB. The
passwords are salted and hashed through the bcrypt library.

When the user logs in, the inputted username and password are parsed. Then, I 
pull the record matching the username from MongoDB. If either there is no
matching record or if bcrypt determines the provided password is invalid, 
then an error message is returned and the user is redirected.


---Objective 4---
Whenever a user logs in, I use Python's "secrets" library to generate a random
token of length 22. This token is then stored with the user in MongoDB. Then
the user is redirected to the home page, where their username and token is 
set as the cookies. Now that the cookies are set, the user is authenticated
and logged in for every subsequent request.


---Bonus---
To check the passwords, I created a password checking function in
"functions.py" (line 151). This functions takes in a password and checks
against all of the provided requirements. For the additional criteria, I chose
to require that the first letter in the password is a capitalized letter.

When the password is parsed from the register form, the function is used to
check the password. If the function returns False, the password does not
meet the criteria and an error message be shown.
